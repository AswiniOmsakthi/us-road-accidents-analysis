## Purpose

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes U.S. road accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. It uses data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques to understand the key factors contributing to accidents.

## Key Features

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing accident frequency by time, location, and weather conditions.
- Identifying correlations between accident severity and various factors.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Loading and cleaning data.
- Handling missing values.
- Feature engineering for enhanced analysis.
- Data Transformation

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Training machine learning models to predict accident severity based on features like weather, time, and road conditions.

### 4. Evaluation
- Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
- Analyzing feature importance for better interpretability.

### 5. Model Extraction
- Extracting model as .pkl file
